# BCNN

This repository contains example R code to implement a Bispectrum-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) for classification of nonlinear time series. This is based on the paper <ins>Nonlinear Time Series Classification Using Bispectrum-based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</ins> by P.A. Parker, S.H. Holan, and N. Ravishanker (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02353).
